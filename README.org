This repository contains the source code for an opinionated encrypted messaging library
using [[https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/][MLS]] as the E2E encryption primitive, Sqlite as the local storage provider,
[[https://docs.bsky.app/][Bluesky]] as the identity provider, and decentralized personal data stores as the
delivery service.

It defines its own application-layer protocol on top of MLS that is
designed to be sensible and ready to integrate into other systems.

** Architecture

- All local state will be stored in a sqlite database.
- We will use people's PDS's as the backend for storing their [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420.html#name-key-packages][KeyPackages]]. This
  will be using a custom Lexicon that is still TBD.
- We will

** Tasks

*** TODO Create lexicon to hold keypackages.
